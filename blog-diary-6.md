### Observations

One of the things I've noticed working on personal projects is that complexity scales over time. I.e. the challenge to make a change on an existing tool is much harder than trying to build a piece of functionality completely fresh, even if it's a solo project. 

I think this roughly maps to my experience working with larger teams as well.

I'm curious what the root cause of this is. It basically means that as a project goes on management is more and more necessary to make the next incremental piece of work, regardless of whether or not the complexity of the project increases.

This is in part because at the start of the project the low hanging fruit gets added and the remaining work involves understanding how to fit the new work in.

I'm curious though, from a management perspective (either like task management or team management) if this can be reduced to a linear function or
