## Getting into the nitty gritty

Starting to get into the overall architecture of the game now.

- Getting React Router Working
- Getting
- Trying to make a decision on whether or not I want the game to be "rewindable"

This is the part of the process where I start getting a little bit disorganized.

All of a sudden it feels so close and I can feel myself trying to work in leaps and bounds to get to the end, eschewing all the hard faught discipline I added at the beginning.

- Create a url route to consume it (let's just make it easy)
  - url/recreate/ZZKU19dkaZ (I think going down this path is cooler. Obviously there's nothing hiding in here, but it makes the share seem more fun.)
  - game url /game/00/11/22/11/
- Add a share button to the screen that generates the url and pops out a modal with the share screen
- figure out how to generate modals with react again, lol
- Add crypto back to it
- Make it look a bit nicer
- Get the end state looking better (own path, lights up the buttons, disables the rest, all that jazz)
- Add the state machine path to actually extract and return the data from history based on the context
